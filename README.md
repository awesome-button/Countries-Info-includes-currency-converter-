### Countries Info including Currency Converter

### Description
This website allows to efficiently search for countries. When a searched country is found,
information such as the country's capital, population, currencies and languages are displayed
in the country box. The currency converter is also included and allows to convert
from Swedish krona to the country's currency.

### APIs
https://restcountries.eu and https://free.currconv.com have been used in this project.

### What else could be done if more time would be allocated for this assignment?

Regarding the website functionality:

- A reverse converter could be added to convert from the country's currency to SEK.
  Conversion to other currencies could also be added.
- Search of countries by currency could be added.
  Sometimes it is useful to see in which countries the same currency is used.
- Search of countries by capital could be added.


Regarding graphic profile and UI:

- An external library could be used to achieve a better graphic profile for the website.
- In general, more time and effort could be put into the graphic profile of the website.
- The website is responsive and should be running in an acceptable way on mobile devices,
  but more effort could be put into that.
- The website functionalities have been tested in Google Chrome and Firefox browsers.
  It would be necessary to test it in other browsers.

Regarding the code:

- The code readability would benefit from some additional comments.
- API requests are made directly in App component in the current version,
  it would be reasonable to put them into a service folder.
